# Weather App

The aim of the project is to test and explore some of the basic Node.js funtionalities. It uses LocationIQ and DarkSky APIs for data retrieval.

The user enters an address, the app retrieves the coordinates of the address using LocationIQ. 
Then, the app retrieves the current weather of the given location using the retrieved coordinates and DarkSky.

You may find the API call functions under **api/utils.js**  
The server is run on **server/app.js**  
You may find the HTML templates and static files under **server/files**
